1. You're super cool.
2. When you do the "love youuuu" look and shoulder shrug, it's kind of adorable
3. I love your laugh. And maybe you don't, but I don't care. It's awesome and so is the little crinkle in your nose.
4. You are the absolute perfect size for hugs and hand holding. It's kind of great actually.
5. You're wit and sarcasm is almost a match to mine, which is cool. Cause I can make fun of you for nothing and know you won't hate me-- for long.
6. You can cook some damn great breakfast- I appreciate that a lot.
7. Your eyes are an amazing blue and I could probably stare into them for ages.
8. Your willingness to try new things spurs me on to do the same and I love that about you.
9. I'm pretty sure you're 5'11.5", but I'm willing to pretend it's 6'.
10. I know you love me and that thought alone keeps me going when days get really tough. 

11. ;)
